Welcome to my Graduation Project repository.
Thank you for your time to explore my experience.

Kindly download the zipped file that is named : "WebApplication1-master"

Steps to run the Project:
- Extract the file.
- Open the Visual Studio file named : "WebApplication1.sln"
- Run the main view named : Index.cshtml

*Kindly note that not all functions will work properly due to Database connection
and this is a small part of the whole project
